Version: pre-Alpha

Module Description
==================

This Python script reads Smart Game Format (SGF) files for Go games and checks if they have a valid result.
If a file does not have a valid result, it can optionally be deleted. The script can process all SGF files
in a given folder.

Functions:
- read_sgf(file_name: str, file_directory: str, do_deletion: bool): Reads a single SGF file and checks
if it has a valid result. If it does not have a valid result and do_deletion is True, the file will be deleted.
- read_all_sgf_in_folder(folder_directory: str, do_deletion: bool = False): Reads all SGF files in a folder
and calls read_sgf for each file.

Parameters:
- file_name (str): The name of the SGF file to read.
- file_directory (str): The directory where the SGF file is located.
- do_deletion (bool): If True and the SGF file does not have a valid result, the file will be deleted.

Usage:
- Modify the value of games_folder_path_absolute or games_folder_path_relative to the path of the folder
containing the SGF files.
- Call read_all_sgf_in_folder to process all SGF files in the folder. Set do_deletion to True if you want
to delete files without a valid result.

Note:
- requires the os and board modules to be imported
